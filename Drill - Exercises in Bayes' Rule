A diagnostic test has a 98% probability of giving a positive result when applied to a person suffering from Thripshaw's Disease, and 10% probability of giving a (false) positive when applied to a non-sufferer. It is estimated that 0.5 % of the population are sufferers. Suppose that the test is now administered to a person whose disease status is unknown. Calculate the probability that the test will:

p(positive | diseased) = .98
p(positive | not diseased) = .10 <- False Positive
p(diseased) = .005
p(not diseased) = .995

1) Be positve
p(positive) = .1044

2) Correctly diagnose a sufferer of Thripshaw's
p(positive | diseased) = .98

3) Correctly identify a non-sufferer of Thripshaw
p(negative) = 1 - p(positive) = 1 - .1044 = .8956
p(negative | not diseased) = .8955/.995 = .9

4) Misclassify a person 
p(misclassify) = 1 - (.0049 + .8955) = .0996
